1.What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?
STM32(ARM (CORTEX - M4)

2.What does GPIO stand for?
GPIO stands for general-purpose input/output which is a generic pin on an integrated circuit.

3.Is the provided delay function accurate? Why or why not? EDIT This question will be disregarded as this delay function does not have parameter Sorry for the confusion

4.What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two Green LEDs?
Port E pin 11
Port E pin 15

5.What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?
GPIO_pin GPIO_Mode GPIO_OType GPIO_speed GPIO_PuPd

There are many difficulties in this lab, and TA give a a lot of assistant because I don't have a partner. At first I don't knoe the basic concept of GPIO, and the two buttom on the STM32 really confuse me a lot. The GPIO function also takes me a while to understand how to test the function and enlight the led on the board.
