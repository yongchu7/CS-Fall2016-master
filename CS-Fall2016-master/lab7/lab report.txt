volts are required for the power, and the position is near the top right which is a black rectangle.

2. To set up the accelerometer and magnetometer

3. To import the data and set it to array, and put is to accel data array.

4.to see how computation formule can change the tilt compensate, and the compass may not flat.


Difficulties: I spend a lot of time on understand the function form 
step 7.
