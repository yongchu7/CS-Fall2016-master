Simple examples for C335.  These demonstrate the use of C as a testbench, QEMU for
simulation, and GDB for debugging.   Change to an example directory

make       -->   builds .elf file, .lst files with disassemble code for each .s
make test  --> builds, runs qemu
make debug --> builds, runs qemu + gdb
