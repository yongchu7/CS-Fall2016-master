1.2 connections 1 send 1receive.

2.So it can work on several function at one time ,and pin can use for input and output.

3.baud rate is the rate which information is transfered in a communication channel.

4.The newlib_stubs is a c language library so we definitly need it for some function to work,for ex. like the printf which is buildin function included in the library.

5.I can get a curve graph for the data received, so if there is some bugs or pauses, it should be easy to see.

learn:
I have learn how to use serialT to make communication. I also learn how to run the main function with the words count function which is very interesting.

difficults:
what I find is very difficult in this lab is the testing part using serialT,but partner and me figure out how to do this. Putstring part also takes me a whole during the lab.
