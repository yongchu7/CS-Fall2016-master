1.Advantages: By using printf, you can easily see the result of the led lights whether it is on or not. Disadvantage: It can delay the speed.
 2. spiReadWrite reads data and displays on the LCD.
 3. This macro sets the CS pin high, which postpone the action of the SPI master. It is used in initializing f3d_lcd_init() to suspend communicating when initializing.
4. In ASCII, the chars are defined as an unsigned 8bit String
 5.f3d_lcd_fillScreen is faster than f3d_lcd_fillScreen2. It conflicts with the assumption.

Difficulties: We spend a lot of time on how to show the data in pixel, and we make a fillsection function for solving that.
